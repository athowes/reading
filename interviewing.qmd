## [How I build and run behavioral interviews (Ben Kuhn)](https://www.benkuhn.net/behavioral/)

* Hiring is important, spend a few hours on an interview you're going to give
* Write a rubric. What answer would distinguish a good candidate from a great candidate?
* Focus on a small number of skills (1-3)
* "Tell me about a recent time when [situation]. Keep it high level"
* Dig into details to see if they are BSing you
* Create a scoring rubric
